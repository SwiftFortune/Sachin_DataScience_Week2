📘 Python Programming Assignment
Basic Operations • Lists & NumPy • Dictionaries & Sets • File Handling

This repository contains a complete Python script demonstrating several core programming concepts, including arithmetic operations, list handling, NumPy array processing, dictionary usage, set operations, and working with text files.

📂 Project Overview

The project is divided into four major tasks:

✅ Task 1: Basic Operations

This section:

Accepts two integers from the user

Performs the following operations:

Addition

Subtraction

Multiplication

Division

Modulus

Exponentiation

Floor Division

Displays results using formatted f-strings

🧮 Task 2: Lists and NumPy Arrays

A list of 10 numbers is created, and the script performs:

Finding list length

Minimum & maximum values

Adding & removing elements

Sorting (ascending & descending)

The list is then converted into a NumPy array, and the following statistics are calculated:

Mean

Median

Standard Deviation

Variance

Sum of all elements

Count of values greater than 50

Index of minimum and maximum elements

📚 Task 3: Dictionaries and Sets
Dictionary Features

A dictionary named student is created with:

name

age

course

marks

Then:

All key-value pairs are printed

A new key grade is added

Set Features

A set of unique courses is created, demonstrating that duplicates are removed automatically.

Set operations performed:

Union

Intersection

Difference

📁 Task 4: File Handling

This section demonstrates writing and reading data from a text file.

Step 1:

Create a file named student_data.txt and write a single student’s details.

Step 2:

Write details of five students (name, course, marks) into the same file.

Step 3:

Read the file and display only students with marks above 75.
Malformed or empty lines are skipped safely.
